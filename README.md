Nothing to see here, still WIP. Just a little experiment to generate a decent 8x3 keyboard layout based on language preferences.

Initial layout the program found (not final):

## Why 8x3

Lateral motion is bad, stretching and curling is fine. So why not have 3 keys per each finger? On 36 key layouts there are 6 bad keys (inner columns), and 4 rogue punctuation marks. If we keep only letters on the main block, there will be 2 letters that won't fit. That's not a problem however since on a layout this small you'd utilize layers heavily anyway. Here's the form factor I'm working with:
```
□ □ □ □       □ □ □ □

□ □ □ □       □ □ □ □
    □ ■ □   □ ■ □
```



## Goal
